\opening{To whom it may concern:}

        Hello ! My name is Cain Susko, and I am a student in the School of
        Computing at Queen's University. 

        During my time studying, I have learned that computing is the
        science of systems. This was a breakthrough for me as I immediately saw
        how everything is a system -- and thus the theories of computing and
        information science can be applied to nearly anything. This not only
        made me more passionate about trying to develop systems -- but also
        gave me a new purpose to try and optimize the systems around me;
        allowing me to develop my skills as a computer scientist on a personal
        level.

        I would be over the moon if you might consider me for a position -- as
        I have an insatiable desire to learn more; and I would be so grateful to
        experience what different company cultures and ideas have to offer in
        the field of computing.

        Thank you for your time and consideration -- and I look forward to your
        response.

\closing{Kindly,}

\end{letter}
