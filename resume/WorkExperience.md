# Work Experience

### $\years{2022 \rightarrow 2023}$Head Speaker & Policy Officer$\place{Queen's Computing Students' Association}$

During the course of the school year, I have been working with the VP of
Operations in order to create a system that will allow us to advance the goals
of the association, despite the quick turnover in student government. Our main
goal is to implement a systematized institutional memory; stored on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Queen-s-COMPSA); which will then be readily
available for later generations to reference and evolve from. I also conduct
General Assemblies and manage the reform of [The
Constitution](https://github.com/Queen-s-COMPSA/Documentation).

### $\years{2021 \rightarrow 2022}$Test Developer$\place{Metronome Growth Systems}$

Over the past two summers I have worked as a test developer at MGS. Both years
I have found the experience invaluable, as it gives me a chance to apply my
learning from school -- but also gives hands on experience with other tools,
like git and agile practices, that a developer should be familiar with.
I thoroughly enjoyed working here and I'm very excited to get more experience
elsewhere !
