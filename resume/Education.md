### $\years{2020 \rightarrow 2024}$BCompH, Software Development$\place{Queen's University}$

I am currently in my Third year of Software Design at Queen's University. Our
main topics this year include: software development models, software
specifications, and algorithmic complexity. I have also spent much time working
with project groups as a "SCRUM" master, helping lead a team to effectively
develop an application. 

### $\years{2020}$High School Diploma$\place{{Whistler Secondary School}}$

I took Computer Science with Mr. Walzl in Grade 12. The experience of
understanding the problems given to me, and then coming up with a solution for
them -- was eye opening for me. It ignited a passion for problem solving and
tinkering that I haven't been able to shake.
